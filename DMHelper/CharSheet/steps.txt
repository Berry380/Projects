STEPS FOR FILLING OUT A CHARECTOR SHEET:

In order to automatically fill a charector sheet in the most appropriate way, we must group everything into portions. 
The way I see this is to break each aspect of the charector into refrences to the charetors stats
For example, all of the ability checks are related to a specific stat
Using this, we should set some pre determined rules for each class to properly define what each class would want

This is the list prefrences go from left to right: 

Barbarian - STR, CON, DEX, WIS,  CHAR, INT
Bard - CHAR, DEX, CON, STR, WIS, INT 
Cleric - WIS, STR, CON, DEX, CHAR, INT
Druid - WIS, DEX, CON, INT (bc nature checks), STR, CHAR 
Fighter - STR, CON, DEX, WIS, INT, CHAR
Monk - DEX, WIS, STR(Athletics checks),  
Paladin - STR & CHAR
Ranger - DEX & WIS 
Rogue - DEX & WIS 
Sorcerer - CHAR & DEX 
Warlock - CHAR & DEX
Wizard - INT & DEX
