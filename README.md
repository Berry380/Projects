# Projects

This repository contains all of my personal side projects I've made

The 'Simple Projects' folder contains some simple practice problems, mainly using the command line for user input
I curated this list using roadmap.sh

As of now, there is only one very simple project:

The 'Teacher Toolbox' conatins my current academic project I am working on in university. This was my first attempt at front-end development (HTML, JS, CSS) and databases (firebase)
More information can be found in the README file in the folder

The 'personalSite' folder contains my most recent project, my resume website. Using all the informtion I gained from the 'Teacher Toolbox' project, I applied those skills in making my own website to contain all my relevent information
More information can be found in the README file in the folder
