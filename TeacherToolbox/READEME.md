**THIS IS NOT THE FINAL PRODUCT. FINAL PROJECT WILL BE UPLOADED ~MAY, 01**

This is my first attempt at a website, so I mainly learned the coding languages themselves, alongside github and Firebase

The most complex features include:
* chat room feature
* student tracker(attendence, grades, general preformance, all stored in firebase),
* student team creation
* random stuendt selector
