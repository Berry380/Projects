**THIS IS NOT THE FINAL PRODUCT. FINAL PROJECT WILL BE UPLOADED ~MAY, 01**

This is my first attempt at a website, so I mainly learned the languages for web development(HTML, JS CSS), alongside github and Firebase

The most complex features include:
* Chat room feature
* Student tracker(attendence, grades, general preformance, all stored in firebase),
* Student team creation
* Random stuendt selector
